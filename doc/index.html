<h1>libModglue: a C++ library for handling co-processes</h1>
<h2 class="author">Kasper Peeters, kasper.peeters (at) aei.mpg.de</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<div class="text">
The libModglue library is a C++ library with classes for forking external
processes and asynchronous reading from streams. It takes
away the burden of all subtleties involving the Unix <tt>fork</tt> 
call. The asynchronous read facility enables one to read on
multiple input streams at the same time, without losing any
of the standard C++ stream facilities.</div>

<div class="text">
There are also several small additional programs bundled with modglue,
such as a program to add readline capability to any command line
program.  Moreover, the modglue library extends the idea of standard
Unix pipes by providing a general framework for the creation of new
processes with more than just the standard stdin/stdout/stderr
pipes.</div>

<h2>Simple example<h2>
<blockquote>
<table width="80%"><tr><td bgcolor="#e0e0e0"><pre>
#include &lt;modglue/modglue.hh&gt;

modglue::pipe foopipe("foo", modglue::pipe::input,  0);
modglue::pipe barpipe("bar", modglue::pipe::output, 1);

void print(const string& txt)
   {
   cout << "received " << txt << " on foo pipe" << endl;
   cout << "sending something on bar pipe" << endl;
   while(txt!="end") {
      string str;
      if(!foopipe.read(str,2))
         break;
      }
   barpipe.sender("thank you!");
   }

int main(int argc, char **argv) 
   {
   modglue::main mm(&argc, &argv);

   mm.add(pipe1);
   mm.add(pipe2);

   foopipe.receiver.connect(slot(print));
   
   mm.run();
   }

<h2>Utilities</h2>
<blockquote>
Several small programs are bundled with modglue. They provide some
additional functionality that was easy to implement with the library,
or are generally useful for command-line driven programs. 
<dl>
<dt><a name="ptywrap"><strong>ptywrap</strong></a></dt>
   <dd>Starts a program with stdin/stdout/stderr connected to a pseudo
       tty device, and map them to fd 0,1,2. This can be used to trick
       programs like <tt>ftp</tt> or <tt>sed</tt> into thinking that
       they are running interactively.
       <blockquote><small>
       <pre>> ptywrap [unix executable]</pre></small></blockquote>
		 is all you need to know.
   </dd>
<p>
<dt><a name="prompt"><strong>prompt</strong></a></dt>
   <dd>The prompt utility wraps other programs such that their input
       has the well-known readline behaviour. In other words, you can
       use the cursor keys for editing, there is a history, and so on.
       Useful for programs like <tt>ftp</tt> that lack this
       functionality.
