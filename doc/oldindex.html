<a name="overview">
<h3>Overview</h3> 
<blockquote>
Modglue is a combination of several software tools that assist in
writing and running programs connected to each other using standard
Unix pipes. There are two main parts to it, the modglue library and
the modglue shell. In more detail:
<dl>
<dt><a href="#library">modglue library</a></dt>
<dd>This is a C++ library with classes for forking external
processes and asynchronous reading from streams. It takes
away the burden of all subtleties involving the Unix <tt>fork</tt> 
call. The asynchronous read facility enables one to read on
multiple input streams at the same time, without loosing any
of the standard C++ stream facilities.</dd>
<dt><a href="#shell">modglue shell</a></dt>
<dd>A shell with special support for arbitrarily connecting
process pipes together, in a way that goes beyond the standard
Unix linear pipe idea (a bit like ksh co-processes, but much
more powerful). In contrast to existing shells, you can start
any number of processes and connect their stdin/stderr/stdout
pipes in any way you like, not just linear as usual.</dd>
</dl>
Each of these is explained in more detail below. There are also
several small additional programs bundled with modglue, such as a
program to add readline capability to any command line program.
<p>
Moreover, the modglue library extends the idea of standard Unix pipes
by providing a general framework for the creation of new processes
with more input or output pipes. The modglue library has support for
this built in, but the setup is general and can be used from any
language.
<p>
In general, the idea behind modglue is that the Unix pipe concept
is very powerful, but insufficient to construct interactive programs
that require bidirectional communication between processes. The
library and shell extend this concept in a completely backwards
compatible way such that large robust systems can be built from
individual Unix building blocks.
<p>
The idea of "circularly connected pipes" is not new, but usually only
implemented in an ad-hoc fashion. See for instance <a
href="http://www.satisoft.com/satshell/">satshell</a>, which is a gui
tool which reads gui building commands from stdin and writes event
information (pressed buttons and so forth) to stdout. In this case,
the satshell program itself is given a program to which it should
connect its stdin and stdout. For another similar idea (though without
implementation), see this <a
href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/171/">Freshmeat editorial</a>
by David Symonds.  Modglue separates the connection logic from the
actual program (in the context of satshell, the gui tool would be one
process and the script another, and modglue would connect their
stdin/stdout pipes in a circular way). 
<p>
Once Unix building blocks are more easily connected in order to
build complex programs, one can perhaps start building graphical tools
to do this (an example of this approach, though with custom building
blocks instead of programs that stick to the Unix pipe philosophy, can
be found in <a href="http://www.triana.co.uk/">triana</a>).

<h3><a name="shell">Modglue shell overview</a></h3> 
<blockquote>
On Unix systems, the standard way to combine small
programs into bigger ones is to tie them together using pipes. As all
standard conforming programs have three standard pipes (stdin, stdout,
stderr) open, it is easy to feed the output of one program into
another one:
<blockquote>
<pre>wget -O - http://somewhere | grep "something"</pre>
</blockquote>
However, this way of connecting programs is limited in the sense that 
data only flows one way (from the first program to the second and so
on, but never back).
<p>

Some shells have ways to circumvent this limitation. The
<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jlk/kornshell/doc/man93.html#Commands">korn
shell</a> has so-called "co-processes", which you can start as
<blockquote>
<pre>program |&</pre>
</blockquote>
after which you can read from and write to the standard pipes. A
similar concept exists in <a
href="http://sunsite.dk/zsh/Doc/Release/zsh_5.html#IDX27">zsh</a>,
where co-processes are started by pre-fixing them with the command 
"coproc". Although very useful, these shells only allow for a single
co-process.
<p>
Moreover, there is no standard way
to extend the number of input/output pipes that a program can have.
(co-processes do not allow for input redirection to startup arguments; since many
programs can only take their arguments from argv and not from stdin, this is
(unfortunately) a requirement. Also, these guys do not provide a pseudo-tty so most
programs started as coprocesses will start buffering).
<p>
The modglue library takes the Unix concept one step further
and allows programs to open more than these three standard
pipes. Furthermore, the links between programs can be more flexible
(you can have complicated graph-like structures instead of just a
single linear pipe) and writing programs that listen on multiple
pipes in a non-blocking way is considerably easier. For instance,
a program could be prompting the user with a dialog for entering
a url, then send that request out through its output pipe,
and read in any responses through its input pipe.
<p>
The modglue library implements a strict superset of the standard Unix
pipe idea: all normal Unix programs can be used as modglue building
blocks, the only limitation being that these programs of course
have only the three standard pipes.
<p>
<p>

There are two types of programs in the modglue world: <strong>unix executables</strong> and
<strong>modglue executables</strong>. The second category is a strict superset of the first one; all 
modglue executables are also unix executables, though they may not be able to offer full 
functionality when run from a unix shell instead of the modglue shell.

<h3><a name="shellmanual">Modglue shell user manual</a></h3> 
<blockquote>
Modshell is the analogue of a normal unix shell like bash or csh. It
contains the logic to tie sockets of various modglue executables
together and spawn new processes. However, it is intended to be usable
as a replacement for a normal Unix shell, in the sense that running
programs in the normal Unix way is supported (with the standard
notation, eg. using the '&amp;' character to start programs in the
background and the '|' character to connect stdout/stdin of
programs). In more detail, the options are:

<dl>
<dt><em><strong>start</strong> programs immediately</em></dt>
  <dd>This is like starting programs on a Unix shell. Just type the
      command (followed by its arguments, if any) and press return. 
      You will not get a prompt back before 
      the program returns. The stdin/stdout/stderr sockets of the
      program will be connected to the stdin/stdout/stderr sockets
      of the modshell.
      <p>
      If you try to start Unix executables this way, they will automatically
      be wrapped using the "<tt><a href="#ptywrap">ptywrap</a></tt>" command.
  </dd><p>
<dt><em><strong>start</strong> programs in the background</em></dt>
  <dd>This is again like starting programs on a Unix shell. Just type the
      command (followed by its arguments, if any) followed by a '&amp;'
      character and press return. Any output will be buffered, but in
      contrast to the situation in Unix, you can connect the stdout/stderr
      (or any socket, for that matter) of the running program even
      <em>after</em> the program has been started.
  </dd><p>
<dt><em><strong>list</strong> all running and runnable programs</em></dt>
  <dd>Type the command "<tt>jobs</tt>". This produces a list of the
      following form:
      <blockquote><small>
      <pre>> jobs
13446 running                       xbiff
                                      xbiff::stdin
                                      xbiff::stdout
                                      xbiff::stderr
13447 running                       gtkiowin
                                      gtkiowin::stdin
                                      gktiowin::stdexc
13558 standby, start_on_input       wget -O -
                                      wget::stdin
                                      wget::stdout
                                      wget::stderr
</pre></small></blockquote>
  </dd>
	<p>
<dt><em><strong>list</strong> all socket connections</em></dt>
  <dd>Type the command "<tt>bonds</tt>". This produces a list of the
      all connections between sockets of different executables.
  </dd>
  <p>
<dt><em><strong>add</strong> programs to the runnable list</em></dt>
  <dd>Type the program name, and append a '^' character. This will
      not start the program yet, so that you can still connect
      its socket to those of other programs (see the "connect" command).
      <p>
      Options can be given by adding them in a comma separated list 
      after the '^' character. 
      At the moment, the available ones are <strong>start_on_input</strong>
      and <strong>abort_on_failed_write</strong>.
  </dd><p>
<dt><em><strong>start</strong> programs in the runnable list</em></dt>
  <dd>Type "<tt>[pid] &</tt>" where `<tt>pid</tt>' is the process identifier
      of a process in the runnable list. This is similar to the way suspended 
      unix binaries are restarted in the background in normal unix shells.
  </dd><p>
<dt><em><strong>connect</strong> sockets of different programs</em></dt>
  <dd>Type "<tt>connect</tt>" followed by a space-separated list of the sockets of
      the programs which you want to connect.
      <p>
      There is a shortcut possible if you just want to connect in the
      normal Unix way (connect stdout and/or stderr of one program to stdin of the
      next): just type the program names separated by a pipe symbol '|'.

<a name="faq">
<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><strong>What about threads?</strong></dt>
   <dd>An initial implemention of modglue supported loading modglue executables
       as threads. This was, however, extremely ugly. Studying <a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9dist/">Plan9</a> I have come
       to the conclusion that for almost all tasks it is better to redesign modules
       (divide the functionality differently) in such a way that they can each
       run in individual address spaces. Careful use of the select loop facilities
       of modglue is the right way to go.
   </dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>How does it compare to DCOP, CORBA, XML-RPC and so
on?</strong></dt>
    <dd>What sets modglue apart from other mechanisms to build software using
independent components are its compatibility with the Unix pipe system,
the idea of a shell determining which connections to make (instead of
modules determining themselves to which other module they want to connect)
and its simplicity. Among the other available systems, there is
<a href="http://k-lug.com/doclib/KDE20Development-html/ch13.html">DCOP</a>
(used in KDE, has a special non-ascii communication method that
is incompatible with Unix pipes, modules make explicit requests for
services instead of leaving that to the shell), CORBA and XML-RPC.
<p>
Some of the functionality of modglue can be found in <a
href="http://dev.scriptics.com/">TCL</a>, in particular the ability to 
send data to the stdin of an already forked program. Modglue aims for
a much more basic goal: it just links programs together, nothing more.
In this sense it is a lot simpler than TCL (and it feels more like
a normal Unix shell).
</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>Sockets are bidirectional, so why are all modglue pipes still uni-directional?</strong></dt>
   <dd>Even though modglue uses sockets for all communication between processes,
       the pipes are always either reading or writing pipes, but not both. This
       is done to mimick as closely as possible the Unix pipe idea, which uses
       unidirectional communication (you cannot write to stdin, for instance).
       <p>
       The `other' component of the socket channel is used solely for status information,
       and never directly visible to the user of the program. These status messages
       are suppressed when modglue binaries run in Unix mode, so they do not interfere
       with normal expected Unix pipe behaviour.
   </dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>What names should I give to my pipes?</strong></dt>
   <dd>Even though you have the option of giving arbitrary names to programs, it
       pays off to think about this for a little while. If the program is small
		 enough and the program name itself describes its function, just using
		 <tt>stdin</tt>, <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt> can be a good choice.
		 <p>
		 In case your program is going to write explicit requests for data
		 on a pipe and then listen for the reply on another one, it is good
		 to make the names related. Suggested are <tt>reqout</tt> and <tt>reqret</tt>
       and variations thereof if you need more than one pair.
   </dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>How does message tagging work?</strong></dt>
   <dd>Since the <tt>sendmsg</tt> and <tt>recvmsg</tt> system calls can cut
	up and re-assemble the messages in arbitrary ways, modglue provides an 
	alternative mechanism to make sure that the messages you send are only
	processed at the other end when all the data has arrived. The way in which
	this works is that all data is encapsulated in the following structure
	before it is handed to <tt>sendmsg</tt>:
	<blockquote>
   <table noborder bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
	<tr><th>field</th><th>size (bytes</th></tr>
	<tr><td>version number and flags</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>stream identifier</td><td>8</td></tr>
	<tr><td>length</td><td>4</td></tr>
	<tr><td>data</td><td>length</td></tr>
	</table>
	</blockquote>
	The reader will then be able to figure out whether to wait for more messages
	to come which really belong to the same outgoing message.
	<p>
	See the next question for info about the stream identifier field. 
	<p>
	Obviously this header yields some overhead, and makes it clear that you
	should try to avoid sending only a few bytes of data. Compared to something
	like XML-RPC, the cost is still pretty minimal though.
   </dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>How can I make asynchronous requests for data? (asynchronous remote procedure calls)</strong></dt>
   <dd>If you send a message using the normal <tt>sender</tt> member of a
	pipe, it will be stamped with a system wide unique identifier (see the table
	above). It is, however, possible to send a message with the identifier of
	a previously received message, such that it becomes possible to relate
	a number of messages into one `stream'. 
	<p>
	Making an asynchronous request then goes as follows. Create a message with
	a new identifier, and store the identifier somewhere. When input comes
	in, compare its identifier to what was stored. If they match, it is a reply.
   </dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>What about synchronous (blocking) reads or send/read?</strong></dt>
   <dd>There are no facilities for this, because it very easily leads
	to deadlocks. If your reading process blocks, waiting for data,
	then it blocks everything, including reading from other channels.
   <p>
   If you never block but instead use the main event loop to wait for
	incoming data, you avoid all potential deadlock situations. Just
   think differently.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>How does modglue compare to notification messaging systems
like <a href="http://elvin.dstc.com/doc/index.html">Elvin</a>?</strong></dt>
   <dd>The idea of notification systems is always that various
	programs send messages out, and other programs can decide to
	subscribe to these messages (based on the content). The Plan9
	<strong>plumbing</strong> concept is similar in spirit.
   <p>
   In modglue, the user who starts processes decides which pipes it is
   going to listen to. This puts a little bit more burden on the user,
   but removes altogether a complicated layer of message distribution
	algorithms. Modglue is thus simpler, at the expense of needing a 
   user willing to do a little bit more work.
   </dd>
</p>
<dt><strong>Is it fast enough?</strong></dt>
   <dd>Obviously, you cannot expect a few thousand small read/writes from one process
	  to the other to be anywhere near as fast as the same number of direct function calls
     in a linked library. Therefore, it pays off to think about how to group your data
	  into big chunks if you want to have maximum speed.
   </dd>
